# Bootstrap different approaches for gene expression analysis

This repository is designed for the purpose of 

1. Learning limma and Deseq2 (and other).
2. Bootstrap approaches - testing robustness

## TODO: Understand processing step and input/ output of both approaches.
## TODO: Design a basic pipeline for each first. 
## TODO: Bootstrap both approaches.
## TODO: Compare both approches with the same plots/tests used in undergrad work
## TODO: Use other tests (ROC curve, confusion matrix?)
